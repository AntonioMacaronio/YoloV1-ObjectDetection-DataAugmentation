# Object Detection with YoloV1 
This repository contains an implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection which uses a deep convolutional neural network.

The dataset used for training is Pascal VOC, located here: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/

Main ideas behind Yolo
1. YoloV1 uses an architecture coined 'darknet' by authors. It's a convolutional neural network with maxpooling.
2. Yolo splits up an image into an SxS grid, where
